# ABSTRACT

# Intro

# BACKGROUND

Air Quality Index (AQI) is a standardized system used to measure the
quality of the air around us. The AQI is calculated using the four major
air pollutants, as determined by the Clean Air Act, which are
ground-level ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, and sulfur
dioxide. AQI is measured on a scale of 0-500, with 0 being the cleanest
air and 500 being the most hazardous. This categorizes 0 as the highest
air quality and 500 as the lowest air quality. AQI is a useful tool that
has become integrated into our weather apps, making it accessible to the
majority of the population. One of the primary causes of death in urban
areas is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD can be
caused by many factors including tobacco use, occupational factors,
infection, and air pollution. This disease progresses slowly and worsens
with prolonged exposure. The damage is usually not reversible and can
lead to pulmonary failure. There are many factors that play into the
prevalence of COPD like region, age, and sex.

# STUDY QUESTION and HYPOTHESIS

With this information in mind, we have posed the following question: “Do
areas of low air quality have higher rates of Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?” Although there are many factors that
influence COPD, if there is a negative correlation between air quality
and rates of COPD there are many known preventative measures that can be
taken to prevent COPD and improve lung health. These findings can
influence health practices and help those susceptible to COPD avoid risk
factors, such as low air quality. Although there are many factors that
can play into rates of COPD, we hypothesize that this negative
correlation will exist and that areas with lower air quality will have
higher rates of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.
